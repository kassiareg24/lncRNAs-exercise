# Analysis of lncRNAs after acute exercise

## Background

This repository serves to analyze the changes in long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) after an acute bout of aerobic or resistance exercise.

Exercise induces a multitude of physiological changes, and many of these
are downstream of changes in cellular gene expression. Though there has
been a great deal of study into protein-coding genes, there has been
little research into the response of non-coding RNAs in response to
exercise. Here, we seek to address this gap. We examine this problem
along two different dimensions - exercise modality and exercise time,
starting with aerobic exercise.

Then, we consider resistance exercise for both short- and long-term gene
expression.

This project is a collaboration between the [Muscle Physiology
Lab](https://skhs.queensu.ca/qmpl/) at Queenâ€™s University and the
[Clarke Laboratory for Quantitative Exercise
Biology](https://www.sfu.ca/clarkelab-bpk.html) at Simon Fraser
University.
