# lncRNA Analysis in Exercise

This repository serves to analyze the changes in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) after an acute bout of aerobic or resistance exercise. 

Exercise induces a variety of macroscopic physiological changes, and these are often a result of changes in cellular gene expression. Though there has been a great deal of research given to changes in protein-coding genes, the non-coding regions of DNA can play a substantial role in regulating gene expression.

This project is a collaboration between the Muscle Physiology Lab at Queen's and the Clarke Laboratory for Quantitative Exercise Biology.
