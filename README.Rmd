# Analysis of lncRNAs after acute exercise

## Background

This repository serves to analyze the changes in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) after an acute bout of aerobic or resistance exercise. 

Exercise induces a multitude of physiological changes, and many of these are downstream of changes in cellular gene expression. Though there has been a great deal of study into protein-coding genes, there has been little research into the response of non-coding RNAs in response to exercise. Here, we seek to address this gap. We examine this problem along two different dimensions - exercise modality and exercise time.

We first show similarities and differences in lncRNA expression after different durations and types of exercise.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Exercise_Modality.png")
```

For a more granular view, we can examine the pairwise venn diagrams between resistance and aerobic exercise.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.show="hold", fig.align="center", out.height="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/Aerobic_Exercise.png", "images/Resistance_Exercise.png"))

knitr::include_graphics("images/1_Hour_Exercise.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/4_Hour_Exercise.png")
```

***

We can expand upon the the differences in lncRNA expression after aerobic exercise compared to baseline using a volcano plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lncRNA_aerobic_volcano.png")
```

***

We can do the same for resistance exercise.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lncRNA_resistance_volcano.png")
```
