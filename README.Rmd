# Analysis of lncRNAs after acute exercise

## Background

This repository serves to analyze the changes in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) after an acute bout of aerobic or resistance exercise. 

Exercise induces a multitude of physiological changes, and many of these are downstream of changes in cellular gene expression. Though there has been a great deal of study into protein-coding genes, there has been little research into the response of non-coding RNAs in response to exercise. Here, we seek to address this gap. We examine this problem along two different dimensions - exercise modality and exercise time, starting with aerobic exercise.

Then, we consider resistance exercise for both short- and long-term gene expression.
